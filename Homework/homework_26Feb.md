# Prototype Continued 

### Swinging Boat
We progressed with our prototype, this time we built a 3D boat using cardboard which we then attatched to a long piece of wood which we screwed to the metal servo attachment.


### Neopixel
We coded a long neopixel strip to display random colors to replicate lights in carnival games.


### Waves
We are planning to have 2 layers of moving waves, so Fatema designed the waves in illustrator then we laser cut them on thin plywood.
