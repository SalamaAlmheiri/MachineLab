1. The first things that came to mind when I first saw the wooden structure that we will be using to display our clock is a puppet show or puppetry. One example of a traditional puppet theatre is "Wayang Kulit" an Indonesia shadow puppetry. It is a traditional form of shadow puppetry that combines intricate leather puppets, gamelan music, and storytelling to depict tales from Hindu mythology, such as the Ramayana and Mahabharata.

2. I think encorporating sound will be an important part in creating the clock because it announces the change in time, and would grab the attention of viewers just like the traditional mechanical clocks. One example of an artist who works with sound is Peter Vogel, a German artist known for his pioneering work in interactive electronic art. One of his notable creations is "The Sound of Shadows," an interactive sound installation that explores the relationship between light, shadow, and sound. In this piece, Vogel utilizes light sensors and electronic circuits to detect the movement of shadows cast by visitors. These movements trigger a series of synthesized sounds, creating an immersive auditory experience that responds dynamically to the interplay of light and shadow in the space.

3. Another artist know for his innovative sound sculptures is Harry Bertoia was an Italian-born American artist and designer. These sculptures, often made of metal rods or wires, produce ethereal sounds when they are touched or moved. Bertoia's sculptures explore the relationship between form, material, and sound, creating immersive sonic environments that invite viewers to interact with the artwork. His sound sculptures have been described as both visually striking and sonically mesmerizing, captivating audiences with their delicate and haunting tones.
